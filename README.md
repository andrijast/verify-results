# Verify Results Browser Extension

Chromium extension that lets you "verify" websites with the aim of assisting you in future searches.

Extension is ~~available~~ in Chrome Web Store: [comming soon]()

**Note: This project is in alpha stage, meaning, only core functionality is displayed. Much more improvement on UI and UX will come in the future.**


## Description (problem and solution)

Say you're looking for a bare simple tool on the web. Often times the "right" page is not listed first on google results.

To "verify" a website means that you've used that site before and it suffices what it says to offer. So next time you search, you wouldn't need to open five links to find the familiar (satisfactory) one.

Verified websites are marked and pushed at top of the google results page.


## ToDo

- [ ] add support for bookmarked webpages
- [ ] fancy "verified" and "bookmarked" tags
- [ ] fancy way to verify a website
- [ ] organize and export verified websites
